Lana Del Rey - Young and Beautiful

I've seen the world
Done it all, had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel-Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, the city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer, young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
